# Ampalaya
Determine crop yield thru leaves

This project is an AI that determines the crop yield of an ampalaya or bitter gourd plant through their leaves.
Collection of images is made manually.
Training and data files could not be uploaded here since images are too big.
You may capture these separately, or contact us through this page.

The python code is already given here for those who want to study it.

Please do cite our study if you are going to use the codes.
Thank you so much.
